# DEFINITIONS OF RISK
- There is no single definition of risk.
- Risk traditionally has been defined in terms of uncertainty.
-  risk is defined as uncertainty concerning the occurrence of a loss.
## Risk Distinguished from Uncertainty
- the term **risk** is used in situations where the probabilities of possible **outcomes are known** or can be estimated with some degree of accuracy
-  **uncertainty** is used in situations where such probabilities **cannot be estimated**.
- For example, the probability of dying at each attained age can be estimated with considerable accuracy. In contrast, the probability of destruction of your home by a meteorite from outer space is only a guess and generally cannot be accurately estimated.
## Loss Exposure
- Because risk is an ambiguous term and has different meanings, many authors and corporate risk managers use the term loss exposure to identify potential losses.
- A **loss exposure** is any situation or circumstance in which a loss is possible, regardless of whether a loss actually occurs.
 - Examples of loss exposures include manufacturing plants that may be damaged by an earthquake or flood, defective products that may result in lawsuits against the manufacturer, possible theft of company property because of inadequate security, and potential injury to employees because of unsafe working conditions.
 ## Objective Risk (ریسک عینی)
 - **Objective risk** (also called degree of risk) is defined as the relative variation of actual loss from expected loss.
- For example, assume that a property insurer has 10,000 houses insured over a long period and, on average, 1 percent, or 100 houses, burn each year. However, it would be rare for exactly 100 houses to burn each year. In some years, as few as 90 houses may burn; in other years, as many as 110 houses may burn. Thus, there is a variation of 10 houses from the expected number of 100, or a variation of 10 percent.
- Objective risk declines as the number of exposures increases.
- In our previous example, 10,000 houses were insured, and objective risk was 10/100, or 10 percent. Now assume that 1 million houses areinsured. The expected number of houses that will burn is now 10,000, but the variation of actual loss from expected loss is only 100. Objective risk is now 100/10,000, or 1 percent. Thus, as the square root of the number of houses increased from 100 in the first example to 1,000 in the second example (10 times), objective risk declined to one-tenth of its former level.

## Subjective Risk (Perceived Risk) (ریسک ذهنی - یا درک شده)
- **Subjective risk** (perceived risk) is defined as uncertainty based on a person’s mental condition or state of mind.

- For example, assume that a driver with several convictions for drunk driving is drinking heavily in a neighborhood bar and foolishly attempts to drive home. The driver may be uncertain whether he will arrive home safely without being arrested by the police for drunk driving. This mental uncertainty or perception is called subjective risk.
- The impact of subjective risk varies depending on the individual.
- a low subjective risk results in less conservative driving behavior.

# CHANCE OF LOSS

- Chance of loss is defined as the probability that an event will occur. Like risk, probability has both objective and subjective aspects.

## Objective Probability
- **Objective probability** refers to the long-run relative frequency of an event based on the assumptions of an infinite number of observations and of no change in the underlying conditions. 

- Objective probabilities can be determined in two ways. 
  - First, they can be determined by deductive reasoning (استدلال استقرایی یا قیاسی). These probabilities are called a priori probabilities. For example, the probability of getting a head from the toss of a perfectly balanced coin is 1/2 because there are two sides, and only one is a head. Likewise, the probability of rolling a 6 with a single die is 1/6 since there are six sides, and only one side has six dots. 
   - Second, objective probabilities can be determined by inductive reasoning rather than by deduction. For example, the probability that a person age 21 will die before age 26 cannot be logically deduced. However, by a careful analysis of past mortality experience, life insurers can estimate the probability of death and sell a five-year term life insurance policy issued at age 21.

## Subjective Probability
- **Subjective probability** is the individual’s personal estimate of the chance of loss.
- Subjective probability need not coincide with objective probability.
- for example, people who buy a lottery ticket on theirbirthday may believe it is their lucky day and overestimate the small chance of winning. A wide varietyof factors can influence subjective probability,including a person’s age, gender, intelligence, education, and the use of alcohol or drugs.

## Chance of Loss Versus Objective Risk
- Chance of loss is the probability that an event that causes a loss will occur.
- Objective risk is the relative variation of actual loss from expected loss.
- The chance of loss may be identical for two different groups, but objective risk may be quite different.
- For example, assume that a property insurer has 10,000 homes insured in Los Angeles and 10,000 homes insured in Philadelphia, and that the chance of a fire in each city is 1 percent. Thus, on average, 100 homes should burn annually in each city. However, if the annual variation in losses ranges from 75 to 125 in Philadelphia, but only from 90 to 110 in Los Angeles, objective risk is greater in Philadelphia even though the chance of loss in both cities is the same.

## PERIL AND HAZARD
- **Peril** is defined as the cause of loss. If your house burns because of a fire, the peril, or cause of loss, is the fire.

- A **hazard** is a condition that creates or increases the frequency or severity of loss. There are four major types of hazards:
  - Physical hazard
     - A physical hazard is a physical condition that increases the frequency or severity of loss. 
     - icy roads, defective wiring in a building, defective lock on a door
  - Moral hazard (خطر اخلاقی)
    - Moral hazard is dishonesty or character defects in an individual that increase the frequency or severity of loss.
    - faking an accident to collect benefits from an insurer, submitting a fraudulent claim, inflating the amount of a claim, intentionally burning unsold merchandise (کالا) that is insured.
  - Attitudinal hazard (morale hazard) (خطر رفتاری)
    - Attitudinal hazard is carelessness or indifference to a loss, which increases the frequency or severity of a loss.
    - leaving car keys in an unlocked car, leaving a door unlocked, changing lanes suddenly on a congested (شلوغی-ازدحام) expressway without signaling
  - Legal hazard
    - Legal hazard refers to characteristics of the legal system or regulatory environment that increase the frequency or severity of losses.
    - adverse jury verdicts (احکام), large damage awards in liability lawsuits


## CLASSIFICATION OF RISK

- Pure and speculative risk (ریسک محض و سوداگرانه)
    - **Pure risk** is defined as a situation in which there are only the possibilities of loss or no loss. The only possible outcomes are adverse (loss) and neutral (no loss). 
    - Examples of pure risks include premature death, job-related accidents, catastrophic (فاجعه آمیز) medical expenses, and damage to property from fire, lightning, flood, or earthquake.
    - **speculative risk** is defined as a situation in which either profit or loss is possible. 
    - For example, if you purchase 100 shares of common stock, you would profit if the price of the stock increases but would lose if the price declines. Other examples of speculative risks include betting on a horse race, investing in real estate, and going into business for yourself.
    - private insurers generally concentrate on pure risks and do not emphasize the insurance of speculative risks.
    - the law of large numbers can be applied more easily to pure risks than to speculative risks. The law of large numbers is important because it enables insurers to predict future loss experience. In contrast, it is generally more difficult to apply the law of large numbers to speculative risks to predict future loss experience.
    - society may benefit from a speculative risk even though a loss occurs, but is harmed if a pure risk is present and a loss occurs. For example, a firm may develop new technology for producing inexpensive computers. As a result, some competitors may be forced into bankruptcy. Despite the bankruptcy, society benefits because the computers are produced at a lower cost. However, society normally does not benefit when a loss from a pure risk occurs, such as a flood or earthquake that destroys a town or area.
    
- Diversifiable risk and nondiversifiable risk 
    - **Diversifiable risk** (ریسک تنوع پذیر) is a risk that affects only individuals or small groups and not the entire 
    economy.
    - It is a risk that can be reduced or eliminated by diversification (تنوع بخشی).
    - For example, a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and certificates of deposit (CDs) is less risky than a portfolio that is 100 percent invested in common stocks.
    - **nondiversifiable risk** is a risk that affects the entire economy or large numbers of persons or groups within the economy. It is a risk that cannot be eliminated or reduced by diversification.
    - Examples include rapid inflation, cyclical unemployment, war, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes because large numbers of individuals or groups are affected.
    - Because nondiversifiable risk affects the entire economy or large numbers of persons in the economy, it is also called fundamental risk (ریسک بنیادی).
- Enterprise risk (ریسک سازمانی)
  - Enterprise risk is a term that encompasses all major risks faced by a business firm. Such risks include pure risk, speculative risk, strategic risk, operational risk, and financial risk.
  - **Strategic risk** refers to uncertainty regarding the firm’s financial goals and objectives; for example, if a firm enters anew line of business, the line may be unprofitable.
  - **Operational risk** results from the firm’s business operations. For example, a bank that offers online banking services may incur losses if “hackers” break into the bank’s computer.
  - **Financial risk** refers to the uncertainty of loss because of adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and the value of money.
- Systemic risk
  - Systemic risk is the risk of collapse of an entire system or entire market due to the failure of a single entity or group of entities that can result in the breakdown of the entire financial system.
  - For example, the severe 2008–2009 business recession in the United States was the second-worst economic downswing in U.S.
